# Project3_Frontend_React
This project is a group project using the express api calendar, with appointment selecting api.
<br />
Users can click on and select a day on the calendar, which opens a modal containing times available/unavailable for said day.
<br />
When a user clicks on a time slot that is available it will open a second modal where the user will be required to fill out personal information such as name and email to schedule an appointment, but also includes a button to "select a new day and time" to revert back to calendar homepage.
<br />
When a user fills out and submits the information it will render that time slot "unavailable" by greying it out.

	-Add Google Maps to provide a location for the business
	-Add additional "tattoo artists" or employees to schedule appointments
